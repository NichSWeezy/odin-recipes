        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Knock your tastebuds out of the ballpark with this classic take on an American classic. Is a hotdog a sandwich?</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Slice of bread. <em>Sweezy's Tip: For best results don't use name brand bread, but the cheap kind that just says "Sandwich" on it.</em></li>
            <li>1 Raw Hotdog</li>
            <li>Mustard</li>
            <li>Ketchup - If that is your thing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>On a microwave-safe plate, place your raw hotdog down and poke holes in it with a fork.. Apparently this keeps it from exploding?</li>
            <li>Place prepared hotdog in the microwave and cook in increments of 25 seconds until it reaches desired hotness.</li>
            <li>Pull out plate and set to the side.</li>
            <li>Get a slice of bread, and lay the cooked hotdog on the piece of bread.</li>
            <li>Add your mustard and if you are weird go ahead and add ketchup.</li>
            <li>Feel free to add some Lay's Salt & Vinegar chips to your plate for an extra kick.</li>
        </ol>
