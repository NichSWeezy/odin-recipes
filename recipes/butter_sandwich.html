        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Impress your friends and family with this simple to make dish. Inspired by struggle and poverty, this recipe delivers an artificial, yet somewhat realistic flavor of chicken broth, combined with a pleasantly crunchy textured noodle. Enjoy the savior notes of umami as the MSG floods your tongue. You will be begging for more but there is only like 8 bites maximum in a serving.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Find a small pot, that is proportional to noodle cube.</li>
            <li>Fill pot about 1/3 of the way with water.</li>
            <li>Place pot on stove element set to medium/high heat.</li>
            <li>Check your Bitcoin portfolio.</li>
            <li>When water is almost to a boil, drop in noodle cube. Caution, water may spill over sides of pot if you did step 2 wrong.</li>
            <li>Allow noodles to boil to the preferred crunchiness level.</li>
            <li>Turn stove off and remove pot from stove, pour water in sink using a fork to hold the noodles back, or use a strainer if you are fancy. Be sure to leave in enough water to achieve the broth level of your liking.</li>
            <li>Pour contents of pot into a suitable sized bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour in your seasoning packet at this time. Some people choose to do this step while the noodles are boiling, those people cannot be trusted. You lose too much flavor when straining the water.</li>
            <li>Serve with a cold canned coke for maximum enjoyment.</li>
        </ol>
