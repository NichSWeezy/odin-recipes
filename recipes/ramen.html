        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Impress your friends and family with this simple to make dish. Inspired by struggle and poverty, this recipe delivers an artificial, yet somewhat realistic flavor of chicken broth, combined with a pleasantly crunchy textured noodle. Enjoy the savior notes of umami as the MSG floods your tongue. You will be begging for more but there is only like 8 bites maximum in a serving.</p>
